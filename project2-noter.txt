Space invaders design requirements

Monsters move in a block
Monsters move to one side, then one unit down, then to the other side
Monsters move faster once they’ve moved down
The monster nearest the player in each column may shoot
If the player is hit by a shot, one life is lost
If a shot hits one of the barriers, the barrier partially crumbles
The player may only fire his gun once his previous bullet has either hit something or moved off the screen
Sometimes, a special spaceship appears at the top and scrolls quickly by. If hit, random amount of bonus points are earned.
If the player’s bullet hits the barrier, the barrier partially crumbles (i.e. the player is stupid for shooting his own barricade)
Points score and number of lives are tallied at the top of the screen
There must be a high-score list (Toke edit: Jo hurtigere man skyder alle fjenderne, jo bedre er man?)
